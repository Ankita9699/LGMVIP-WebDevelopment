## My process

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

In this project a website is created using HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheet (CSS), and Javascript (JS). 
HTML is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. JavaScript is among the most powerful and flexible programming languages of the web. It powers the dynamic behavior on most websites.

In this project I learnt number of HTML tags such as meta: the desctiption of the HTML data; div: defines division or section; li,ul,ol: used to create list; button: to create image; img: to display images on the web page; h2: headings; section: defines the section of HTML; p: defining paragraphs; nav: set of navigational links; and many more. Also, the use of number of attributes such as class: use for identifier and accessing specific elements; src: specifying the source; and many more are used to enhance the web site with various features.

CSS Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model, that is it deals with layout as a row or as a column. It offers space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities. Flex-direction property and its values row, row-reverse, column and column-reverse is used to align the items along the main axis and cross axis. Flex-container is an area defined using flexbox. The display property can be set to flex, inline-flex to create a flex container. The flexbox container is used widely in this project.

Javascript adds the dymanic behaviour to the web site. The document.querySelector is used to access HTML elements and modified as per the need. Document.querySelectorALl returns all elements in the document that matches a specified CSS selector. Event handler, addEventListerner is used to listens to the events or any action performed on the web page such as clicking the button and the action can be performed on that event.
